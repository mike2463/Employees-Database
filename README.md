# sql-challenge
Within this repository there is the EmployeeSQL folder and inside of that folder is three documents. The first document is the ERD showing the tables that are in the database and how they are connected. The second document is the schema of the database. And the third are the queries that I ran. 
I was able to complete this assignment through the use of SQL documentation and the learning assistants.
